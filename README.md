###### Manali
>Besides natural charm and unparalleled beauty it has a lot of adventurous sports which are a lot fun to do with friends and family.It has a reputation as a backpacking center . Set on the Beas River, itâ€™s a gateway for __skiing in the Solang Valley__ and trekking in Parvati Valley.
It's also a jumping-off point for **paragliding, rafting and mountaineering** in the Pir Panjal mountains, home to 4,000m-high Rohtang Pass.Manali has witnessed a flurry of activity related to hydroelectric power and tourism.<br>Unplanned and rampant construction has led to severe depletion of forests and pollution of river bodies ,however there is a lot of flora and fauna to enjoy the scenic beauty.
